# Fail-to-learn-using-Reinforcement-learning-
## problem Statement 
In real-world control systems (like walking robots or balancing drones), external disturbances such as wind, obstacles, or attacks can destabilize them. This project simulates a similar challenge by introducing an adversarial force during training.
## objective

- Build a custom `CartPole` environment with adversarial force injection.
- Train a PPO agent to **learn to balance** even when attacked randomly.
- Visualize how the trained agent resists falling due to unpredictable pushes.
## Requriement libary 
- gymnasium[box2d]
- stable-baselines3[extra]
- imageio
- moviepy
